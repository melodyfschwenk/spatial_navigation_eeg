# Next Steps After Git Initialization

Follow these steps to complete the Git setup process:

## 1. Open the Project in VS Code

1. Launch VS Code
2. Go to File > Open Folder
3. Navigate to `C:\Users\melod\OneDrive\Desktop\spatial_navigation_eeg` and click "Select Folder"

## 2. Stage Your Files

1. Click on the Source Control icon in the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. You should see all project files listed under "Changes"
3. Click the "+" (plus) icon next to "Changes" to stage all files
   - This action is equivalent to `git add .`
   - Alternatively, stage specific files by clicking the "+" next to individual files

## 3. Make Your Initial Commit

1. Type a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control panel
   - Example: "Initial commit of Spatial Navigation EEG project"
2. Click the checkmark (âœ“) button above the message box or press Ctrl+Enter
   - This creates your first commit

## 4. Publish to GitHub

1. After committing, look for the "Publish Branch" button in the Source Control panel
2. Click "Publish Branch"
3. Select whether you want a "Public" or "Private" repository
4. Enter "spatial_navigation_eeg" as the repository name
5. Click "OK" or "Publish"

VS Code will now:
- Create a new repository on GitHub
- Add it as a remote to your local repository
- Push your committed files to GitHub

## 5. Verify Your Repository

1. After successful publishing, VS Code will show a notification
2. Click "Open on GitHub" in the notification to view your repository in the browser
3. Verify all your files are present in the GitHub repository
4. Check that your directory structure is preserved, including the empty data/ and logs/ directories with .gitkeep files

## Next Steps for Development

Now that your repository is set up:

1. Make changes to files locally
2. Stage and commit changes regularly
3. Push changes to GitHub using the "Sync Changes" button
4. Consider creating branches for new features
