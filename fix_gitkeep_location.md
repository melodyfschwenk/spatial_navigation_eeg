# Fix .gitkeep Files Location

The `.gitkeep` files have been created in the wrong location. Let's create them in the correct project directory:

## PowerShell Commands to Fix

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd C:\Users\melod\OneDrive\Desktop\spatial_navigation_eeg

# Create data and logs directories if they don't exist
if (-not (Test-Path "data")) { mkdir data }
if (-not (Test-Path "logs")) { mkdir logs }

# Create .gitkeep files in the project's directories
New-Item -ItemType File -Path "data\.gitkeep" -Force | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType File -Path "logs\.gitkeep" -Force | Out-Null

# Verify files were created in the right location
if ((Test-Path "data\.gitkeep") -and (Test-Path "logs\.gitkeep")) {
    Write-Host "Both .gitkeep files now exist in the project directory" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "There was an issue creating the .gitkeep files" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

After running these commands, your project will be ready to push to GitHub through VS Code.

## Next Steps

Once the `.gitkeep` files are in the right location:

1. Open VS Code and navigate to your project
2. Go to the Source Control tab (Ctrl+Shift+G)
3. Stage all your files
4. Enter a commit message
5. Click "Publish Branch" to push to GitHub
```
